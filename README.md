# ClaimCatcher Web App Deployment on Heroku

## Problem
Fraudulent insurance claims cost over 100 billion dollars in lost revenue globally. In the continent of Africa, fraud detection is largely manual, delaying claims processing and adding more costs to the insurance companies. ClaimCatcher automates the fraud detection process in medical insurance claims and conducts cost adjustment for claims that are legal and need adjustment. This was a consulting project for Curacel, a claims and fraud detection platform in Africa.

## Solution
Random Forest Classifier for classifying legal claims and fraudulent claims. Multiple linear regression for cost adjustment, where the goal was to predict the amount adjusted for those claims where the approved amount was different than the claim amount.
